# Horiseon-main-page

## Description

This is the landing page of Horiseon, a company that specialised in online reputation and social media management.<br />
I was tasked with refactoring it to make sure it was compliant with the latest standards in regard to HTML semantics and accessibility, so that it's easily browsed by people with disabilities and also better positioned within a search engine's rankings. <br />
This is what I've done to reach those goals:<br />

- I have changed all the non - semantic elements to semantic ones where possible.
- I have refreshed the CSS code so that it interacts with the new writing of the HTML.
- I have made sure that the new website preserves the looks and functionality of the original page. 
- I have rearranged and streamlined the writing of the HTML and CSS files; the sections are now arranged in logical clusters to make sure that future developers can pickup and interpret the code more effortlessly.

As a developer, this job has taught me the symmetry between the writing of the HTML code and the CSS and their interdependencies; I've also consolidated my knowledge of the usage of classes or IDs and learned how to use tags I did not know beforehand, notably the <aria-label> one that I used to create an ALT text for an image referenced in the stylesheet.

## Installation

You can visit the page here at <a href="https://taichi-method.github.io/Horiseon-main-page" target="_blank">https://taichi-method.github.io/Horiseon-main-page </a>

## Usage

This job is a static webpage with simple same - page hashtag links so it doesn't offer significant interactivity. <br />
I provide a screenshot for your convenience.
